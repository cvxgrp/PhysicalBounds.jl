# PhysicalBounds


## Overview
This package contains code to compute bounds on physical devices that are
governed by the Helmhotlz equation[^1]. To get started, check out the examples!

The figures in [Bounds on Efficiency Metrics in Photonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05243)
can be reproduced with code in the `paper` folder of the repository.


#### Examples:
```@contents
Pages = ["examples/bend.md", "examples/lens.md", "examples/mode-converter.md"]
Depth = 1
```
